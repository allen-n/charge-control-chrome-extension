## Description
Cloned from [battery-info-chrome-extension](https://github.com/radibit/battery-info-chrome-extension) by [radibit](https://github.com/radibit).

This extension extends the functionality of [radibit's](https://github.com/radibit) by allowing you to automatically turn a smart outlet on/off at certain charge percentages. This will let you optimize the lifespan of your li-ion batteries!

The extension is using the [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API).

## Required Hardware:
* I'm using [Smart Plug, Gosund Mini WiFi Outlet](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B079MFTYMV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). But any smart plug that can interact with [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/) should work.
* Ability to create IFTT routines with webhook triggers. Get your webhook key by pressing the "Documentation" button on the top right of [this](https://maker.ifttt.com/use) page.

<!-- Features:
- Shows current battery charge level as a badge on the icon (updates on every two minutes)
- Provides information about the remaining time / time until full charge (on icon click)
- Indicates with an icon whether or not the laptop is connected to a power adapter
